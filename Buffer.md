A *data buffer* is a region of a memory used to store data temporarily while it is being moved from one place to another. Usually, the data is stored in a *buffer* as it is retrieved from an input device or just before it is sent to an output device.

A *buffer* also may be used when data is moved between processes that operates at different speeds or have different data rate requirements.

#### Key points:

- **Temporary Storage:** Buffers provide a temporary holding place for data. Data can be read into a buffer at one rate and then read from the buffer at another rate.

- **Data Transfer rate:** Buffers are frequently used in situations where the speed that data is produced is different than the speed at which it can be consumed or processed. The buffer allows the producer and consumer to work independently at their own rates.

- **Smooth Data Flow:** Buffers help in achieving a more continuous and smooth flow of data. Without a buffer, data might need to be sent or received in fixed-size chunks, leading to inefficient or uneven data transfer.

- **Buffer Overflow:** While buffers are useful for managing data flow, it's essential to ensure that the buffer size is sufficient to handle the data being transferred. Buffer overflow can occur if more data is written into a buffer than it can hold, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
